This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is where it all began for me as a React hacker.
In this project I got my head around core React concepts like state manipulation and conditional rendering.
I made this little app while doing Bob Ziroll's free React course on Scrimba. Check out https://scrimba.com/.
